  ## What, Bluelight and Tripsit?
  You read that right. I had volunteered to be a liason between the two, though mostly to learn Tripsit's systems as I embark on my journey back into programming and development trying to transition over to a full time position working on what I love most, a bot that not only saves lives, but can provide social resources, has accessibility options for those who may require individualized functions, or are simply in a state of emergency. I believe we need to account for all of these, when it comes to making life saving programs.
